# simplex
A bare-bones Python 3 implementation of the simplex algorithm, written to
closely mirror Procedure 13.1 in Nocedal & Wright - Numerical Optimization
(2006, 2nd ed., Springer). 
Run simplex_example_13_1.py to print a step-by-step report with details on 
about every iteration. 
Note that Example 13.1 on page 371 contains a number of typos (see the handout
- Example_13_1.pdf) and that simplex will not give output that matches the
example exactly. 

Run simplex_example_7_constraints.py for a slightly larger example problem
(seven constraints), which solves a Phase-I problem to determine a basic 
feasible starting point.
